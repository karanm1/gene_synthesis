# Gene Synthesis Price Forecasting

This project has the goal of compiling data on the cost of gene synthesis over time and across firms with the goal of forecasting the future cost of
synthesis and the scale/magnitude of its use.

## Data
The cost data (data/Gene Synthesis Data) comes from two sources: 
1) From manually checking the websites (and wayback machine archives) of the firms for which data is shown
2) From Rob Carlson's estimates of synthsis costs

## Code
The code for this project is written in Stata
